# gist-api-ruby

> Ruby bindings for the [Gist API](https://developers.getgist.com/).

### Maintenance

We're currently building a new team to provide in-depth and dedicated SDK support.

In the meantime, we'll be operating on limited capacity, meaning all pull requests will be evaluated on a best effort basis and will be limited to critical issues.

We'll communicate all relevant updates as we build this new team and support strategy in the coming months.

## Installation
```ruby
gem 'gist-api-ruby'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle install

Or install it yourself as:
